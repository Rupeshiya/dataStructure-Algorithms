## Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository is serves as an implementation of the various data structures and algorithms that I am studying in my undergrad studies of Computer Science Engineering. I am trying to implement them in 3 languages(C/C++, Python, Java).

Programmers willing to contribute or add more language efficiencies are most welcome to send **pull requests**.

## IMPORTANT
- Always specify the **Problem statement** in a comment at the top of the program.
- You can also give link to a webpage where the problem statement or **tutorial** of that particular program is present.
